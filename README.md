# Fsd-git-demo-2

This repository is created for giving demo.


Things I did for making repository.

+ Created a empty repository named `Fsd-git-demo-2` in [GitHub] (https;//github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# Fsd-git-demo-2" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/HarikaranSubramanian/Fsd-git-demo-2.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. after opened cmd i just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
   + This first line `echo "# Fsd-git-demo-2" >> README.md` created a README.md file
